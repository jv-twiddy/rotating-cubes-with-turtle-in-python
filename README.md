These are some short programs using turtle in python to draw cubes to the screen.

the most interesting is third where i have rotated and transformed the cubes repeatedly to create a swirl.

I have been revisiting it a bit and trying to make more it more of a generalisable tool, see genralisation.py, and gen_demo.py.
